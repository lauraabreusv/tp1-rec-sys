# tp1-rec-sys

The goal of this project is to implement a collaborative movie recommender. It was an assignment of the class on Recommendation Systems (UFMG-2021)
available on the following competition on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/recsys-20211-cfmr.

I've developed using Python an item-based recommender and the results were quite good, although there is plenty room for improvement.
The documentation in Portuguese can be found on the PDF file and the entire python code is on the main.py file.
